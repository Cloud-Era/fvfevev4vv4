Yes, you need to include that part in your Terraform configuration. The `data "azurerm_network_interface"` block fetches the network interface associated with your Azure Key Vault's private endpoint. This is essential because the diagnostic settings need to target the network interface directly, and the data block retrieves the correct resource ID to use.

### Complete Configuration Example

Here's how your complete Terraform configuration might look, including fetching the network interface and setting up the diagnostic settings:

```hcl
# Data block to fetch the Network Interface associated with the Private Endpoint
data "azurerm_network_interface" "kv_pe_nic" {
  name                = azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.resource_group_name
}

# Diagnostic Settings for Key Vault's Private Endpoint Network Interface (NIC)
resource "azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting" "kv_pe_nic_diagnostic" {
  name                       = format("%s-nic-diagnostic", azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.name)
  target_resource_id         = data.azurerm_network_interface.kv_pe_nic.id
  log_analytics_workspace_id = var.central_law_workspace_id

  # Only AllMetrics is available for NICs
  metric {
    category = "AllMetrics"
    enabled  = true
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      log_analytics_destination_type
    ]
  }
}
```

### Key Points to Remember:
1. **Data Block**: The `data "azurerm_network_interface"` block is necessary to retrieve the NIC details for the private endpoint created for your Key Vault. Without this, Terraform will not know which NIC to target for diagnostics.
  
2. **Reference**: The `target_resource_id` for the `azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting` resource references the ID from the NIC data block, ensuring that the diagnostics are applied correctly.

3. **Apply Changes**: After adding this block, remember to run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to apply your changes to the infrastructure.

By including the data block, you'll ensure that your configuration is complete and accurately references the network interface associated with the Key Vault's private endpoint.
