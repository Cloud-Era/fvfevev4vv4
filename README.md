The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the way Azure generates the Network Interface (NIC) name for Private Endpoints. The naming convention can be slightly different from what we initially assumed. Let's try a different approach to get the correct NIC name:

1. First, let's modify the data source to fetch the NIC directly from the private endpoint:

```hcl
data "azurerm_private_endpoint" "kv_pe" {
  name                = azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.name
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}

data "azurerm_network_interface" "kv_pe_nic" {
  name                = element(data.azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.network_interface, 0).name
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}
```

2. Then, update the diagnostic setting resource:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting" "kv_pe_nic_diagnostic" {
  name                       = format("%s-nic-diagnostic", azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.name)
  target_resource_id         = data.azurerm_network_interface.kv_pe_nic.id
  log_analytics_workspace_id = var.central_law_workspace_id

  metric {
    category = "AllMetrics"
    enabled  = true
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      log_analytics_destination_type
    ]
  }
}
```

This approach should work because:

1. We're first fetching the private endpoint data, which includes information about its network interfaces.
2. We're then using that data to get the exact name of the NIC associated with the private endpoint.
3. This method doesn't rely on constructing the NIC name manually, which can be error-prone due to Azure's naming conventions.

Make sure to place these resources after the `azurerm_private_endpoint` resource in your configuration, and ensure that `var.resource_group_name` and `var.central_law_workspace_id` are correctly defined.

If you're still encountering issues, you might want to:

1. Double-check that the private endpoint is being created successfully.
2. Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the network interface.
3. Use `terraform console` to inspect the values of `azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.name` and `var.resource_group_name` to ensure they're correct.
4. Consider adding a `depends_on` block to ensure the data sources are only queried after the private endpoint is fully created:

```hcl
depends_on = [azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe]
```

Remember to run `terraform init` after making these changes to ensure any new provider configurations are downloaded.
