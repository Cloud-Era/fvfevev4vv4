Based on the search results and your query, here's how we can modify the script to include severity levels and ensure we're getting all open code scanning alerts:

```python
import os
import requests
import urllib3
import csv
import datetime
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

def getCodeScanningAlertsEnterprise(enterprise, token, org, page=1, severity=None):
    alerts = []
    headers = {'Authorization': f"Bearer {token}", "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json"}
    url = f"https://api.github.com/enterprises/{enterprise}/code-scanning/alerts?per_page=100&page={page}&org={org}&state=open"
    
    if severity:
        url += f"&severity={severity}"
    
    res = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False)

    print(f"Code Scanning Request URL: {res.url}")
    print(f"Code Scanning Response Status Code: {res.status_code}")

    if res.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Error: {res.status_code}, {res.text}")

    data = res.json()
    alerts.extend(data)

    if len(data) == 100:
        alerts.extend(getCodeScanningAlertsEnterprise(enterprise, token, org, page + 1, severity))

    return alerts

def main():
    headers = ["Organization", "Repository_Name", "Alert Number", "Rule ID", "Severity", "State", "Tool Name", "Description", "URL", "Created At", "Updated At"]
    
    GHToken = os.getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN")
    enterprise_name = "your_enterprise"  # Replace with your enterprise name
    org_list = ["org1", "org2"]  # Replace with your organization names
    severity_levels = ["critical", "high", "medium", "low", "warning", "note", "error"]

    current_directory = os.getcwd()
    current_date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m-%d-%Y")
    csv_file_path = os.path.join(current_directory, f"OpenCodeScanningAlerts_{current_date}.csv")

    total_alerts = 0

    with open(csv_file_path, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(headers)

        for org in org_list:
            for severity in severity_levels:
                codeScanningAlerts = getCodeScanningAlertsEnterprise(enterprise_name, GHToken, org, severity=severity)
                total_alerts += len(codeScanningAlerts)

                for alert in codeScanningAlerts:
                    writer.writerow([
                        org,
                        alert['repository']['full_name'],
                        alert['number'],
                        alert['rule']['id'],
                        alert['rule']['severity'],
                        alert['state'],
                        alert['tool']['name'],
                        alert['rule']['description'],
                        alert['html_url'],
                        alert['created_at'],
                        alert['updated_at']
                    ])

    print(f"Open Code Scanning Alerts CSV file generated at: {csv_file_path}")
    print(f"Total open Code Scanning alerts written: {total_alerts}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Key changes in this version:

1. Added a `severity` parameter to the `getCodeScanningAlertsEnterprise` function to filter alerts by severity.
2. In the `main` function, we now iterate through all severity levels for each organization.
3. The URL in `getCodeScanningAlertsEnterprise` now includes `state=open` to specifically request open alerts.
4. We're using all possible severity levels as mentioned in the documentation: "critical", "high", "medium", "low", "warning", "note", "error".

This script will:
- Fetch open code scanning alerts for each organization in your enterprise, for each severity level.
- Write these alerts to a CSV file named `OpenCodeScanningAlerts_<current_date>.csv`.
- Print the total number of open alerts fetched across all organizations and severity levels.

Remember to:
- Replace `"your_enterprise"` with your actual enterprise name.
- Update `org_list` with the names of your organizations.
- Ensure your GitHub access token is set as an environment variable named `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

This approach should help you retrieve all open code scanning alerts, including their severity levels, across your enterprise. By querying for each severity level separately, we ensure that we're not missing any alerts due to API limitations.
