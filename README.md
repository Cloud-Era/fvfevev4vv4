You’re right! Instead of hardcoding the NIC name, you can dynamically construct the NIC name using Terraform's interpolation functions. This approach makes your configuration more robust and flexible, especially in environments where resource names may vary or change.

### Using Dynamic NIC Name Construction

To derive the NIC name based on the private endpoint's properties, you can use the following approach. This will eliminate the need to hardcode the NIC name and ensure it dynamically reflects the current naming conventions.

### Updated Code Example

Here’s how to modify your data block to dynamically construct the NIC name:

```hcl
# Data block to fetch the Network Interface associated with the Private Endpoint
data "azurerm_network_interface" "kv_pe_nic" {
  name                = "${azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.name}.nic.${substr(azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.private_service_connection[0].private_connection_resource_id, -36, 36)}"  # Dynamically construct NIC name
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}

# Diagnostic Settings for Key Vault's Private Endpoint Network Interface (NIC)
resource "azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting" "kv_pe_nic_diagnostic" {
  name                       = format("%s-nic-diagnostic", azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.name)
  target_resource_id         = data.azurerm_network_interface.kv_pe_nic.id
  log_analytics_workspace_id = var.central_law_workspace_id

  # Only AllMetrics is available for NICs
  metric {
    category = "AllMetrics"
    enabled  = true
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      log_analytics_destination_type
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Dynamic NIC Name Construction**:
   - The NIC name is constructed using:
     - The private endpoint name: `${azurerm_private_endpoint.kv_pe.name}`
     - The suffix `.nic.`
     - A substring of the private connection resource ID, which is extracted from the private endpoint’s `private_service_connection` attribute. Here, `substr(..., -36, 36)` extracts the last 36 characters from the resource ID.
   - Make sure the substring indices correctly reflect the NIC's expected suffix based on the actual format.

2. **Resource Group**: 
   - Ensure that `var.resource_group_name` correctly points to the resource group where your NIC is deployed.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Test the Configuration**: After updating the code, run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to test and apply your changes.
- **Check for Existing Resources**: If you encounter issues, ensure the private endpoint and associated resources are deployed and named correctly according to your naming conventions.

By dynamically constructing the NIC name, your Terraform configuration becomes more adaptable to changes and reduces the risk of hardcoded values causing deployment issues.
