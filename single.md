### **How to Structure the Excel File**
- **Column Headers**:
  - **Step No.**: Sequential step number.
  - **Workflow Type**: The type of workflow (Landing Zone, Furnishing, or Subscription-Level).
  - **Description**: A brief description of the task or configuration step.
  - **Resource Type**: The Azure resource being created or configured.
  - **Key Components**: Main elements or features involved in the resource.
  - **Configuration Details**: Specific settings, values, or parameters for the resource.

This consolidated format ensures that all the workflows are in one place, easily accessible for review or updates.
